## tpByVeg_plots.R

The `tpByVeg_plots.R` script provides exploratory graphs of the sampled temperature and precipitation data from CRU 3.2 and GCMs.
The data are sampled from spatially explicit monthly climate maps over the period 1950-2013 for CRU 3.2 and 2010-2099 for various GCMs.
Sampling is stratified by vegetation class. Samples and sample means by vegetation class are used in various analyses.
