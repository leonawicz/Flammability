## FlammabilityMapMultipliers.R

The `FlammabilityMapMultipliers.R` script multiplies each flammability map in a series by a scalar coeeficient to stretch or compress inter-annual variability in flammability.
For CRU 3.1 historical flammability maps, observation-based coefficients are applied for the years 1950 - 2011.
A small set of discrete coefficient values are used.
Historical CRU-based and projected GCM-based flammability maps outside the 1950 - 2011 period are multiplied by randomized coefficients from the same set.
